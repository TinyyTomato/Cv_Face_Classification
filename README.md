Computer Vision for Face Classification

You may need to put the dictionary 'trainimages' outside the Cv_Face_Classification folder named 'data_set/Face_data/' to run the codes below.
(Or you can adjust yourself to the project.)

Five models were written in ipythonNoteBook which can be directly run.

Have Fun!
